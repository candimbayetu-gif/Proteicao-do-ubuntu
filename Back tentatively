Ubuntu Security Checklist - Simple Explanation

🔐 Basic Must-Do's

1. User & Passwords

```bash
# Check who you are
whoami

# Check if you have sudo access
sudo -l

# See logged-in users
w
```

· Use strong passwords
· Don't use root user for daily tasks
· Only give sudo to trusted users

2. System Updates

```bash
# Update regularly
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Enable automatic security updates
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```

3. Firewall (Like a Bouncer)

```bash
# Check if firewall is on
sudo ufw status

# Turn on firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Basic rules
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

🛡️ Important Security Checks

4. SSH Security (Remote Access)

```bash
# Check SSH status
sudo systemctl status ssh

# Edit SSH config for better security
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

· Change default port (not 22)
· Disable root login
· Use key-based authentication

5. Check Running Services

```bash
# See what's running
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service

# See what's listening on ports
sudo netstat -tulpn
# or
sudo ss -tulpn
```

6. User Accounts

```bash
# See all users
cat /etc/passwd

# See who can sudo
cat /etc/group | grep sudo

# Check for empty passwords
sudo awk -F: '($2 == "") {print}' /etc/shadow
```

🔍 Quick Security Scan

Run these commands to check:

```bash
# 1. Check for updates
apt list --upgradable

# 2. Check firewall
sudo ufw status

# 3. Check failed login attempts
sudo lastb

# 4. Check successful logins
sudo last

# 5. Check suspicious processes
ps aux | grep -E '(ssh|ftp|telnet)'
```
